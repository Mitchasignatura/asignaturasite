A. **Simile** -- a figure of speech comparing two unlike this.
Comparison is shown by the words **like** or **as**.

Examples:

1. Her skin is like a velvety soft rose of petals.

2. Hot chocolate on cold, raining days is as comforting as a mother's
   hug

B. **Metaphor** -- a figure of speech in which a word or phrase
literally denoting one kind of object or idea is used in a place of
another to suggest a likeness between them

Examples:

1. A friend's smile is a ray of sunlight on a cloudy day.

2. Life is a fragile gift that must be handled with care.

C. **Personification** -- a figure of speech, which gives human
attributes or qualities to inanimate objects.

Examples:

1. The sun and the moon constantly play hide-and seek and never manage
   to catch each other.

2. The wind brushes its soft lips upon my cheeks.

D. **Hyperbole** -- a figure of speech which is a statement of
extravagant exaggeration

Examples

Our ancestors get covered with soot from head to toe just trying to cook
rice on their clay stoves.

E. **Irony** -- a statement that expresses something other than or
opposite of the literal meaning.

Examples

Life is now so convenient that we cannot have a moment to rest.
