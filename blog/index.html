<p><strong>(Salin ni: Dr. Romulo N. Peralta)</strong></p>
<p>Si Kinnaree Manorah ay isang prinsesang alamat ng Thai at ang pinakabata sa pitong anak na kinnaree ng Haring Prathum at Reynang Janta kinnaree. Siya ay nakatira sa maalamat na kaharian ng Bundok Grairat. Ang pitong kinnaree ay kalahating babae at kalahating sisne. Sila'y nakalilipad at nagagawang itago ang kani-kanilang pakpak kung kanilang nanaisin. Saloob ng kahariang Krairat (Grairat), nakatago ang kagubatan ng Himmapan kung saan din namamahay ang mga nakatatakot nanilalang na hindi kilala sa daigdig ng mga tao. Sa loob ng kagubatan, nakakubli ang maganda at kaaya-ayang lawa kung saan ang pitong kinnaree ay masayang dumadalaw lalo na sa araw ng Panarasi (kalakihan ng buwan). Sa di-kalayuan ng lawa, nakatira ang isang ermitanyo na nagsasagawa ng kaniyang meditasyon. Isang araw, napadako ang isang binata habang naglalakbay sa kagubatan ng Himmapan. Siya ay si Prahnbun. Nakita niya ang pitong kinnaree na masayang nagtatampisaw sa ilog. Namangha siya sa nakabibighaning kagandahan ni Prinsesa Manorah. Naisip niya na kung mahuhuli niya ang prinsesa, dadalhin niya ito kay Prinsipe Suton, ang anak ng Haring Artityawong at Reyna Jantaivee ng Udon Panjah. Tiyak na matutuwa ang prinsipe at tuluyang mapapaibig ito sa prinsesa. Ngunit naitanong niya sa sarili kung paano niya ito mahuhuli. Alam ni Prahnbun na may ermitanyong nakatira sa malapit ng kagubatan. Pinuntahan niya ito upang magpatulong sa kaniyang balak. Sinabi saka niya ngermitanyo na napakahirap ang manghuli ng kinnaree dahil agad-agad itong lumilipad kapag tinatakot. Ngunit naisip ng ermitanyo na may isang dragon nanakatira sa pinakasulok-sulukan ng kagubatan na maaaring makatulong sa kanila. Nagpasalamat ang binata sa ermitanyo at nagmamadaling lumisan upang hanapin ang dragon. Hindi natuwa ang dragon nang marinig ang balak ni Prahnbun, ngunit napapayag din itong bigyan niya si Prahnbun ng makapangyarihang lubid na siyang panghuhuli niya sa Prinsesa Manorah. Nagpasalamat ang binata at patakbong umalis na dala-dala ang makapangyarihang lubid at patagong tinungo ang ilog kung saan naglalaro ang mga kinnaree. Habang abala sa paglalaro ang mga kinnaree, inihagis ni Prahnbun ang lubid at matagumpay na nahuli si Prinsesa Manorah. Ganun nalamang ang pagkaawa ng ibang mga kapatid ng prinsesa. Ngunit sila'y walang nagawa kundi agad- agad nalumipad dahil sa takot na sila rin ay paghuhulihin. Itinali nang mahigpit ni Prahnbun ang pakpak ni Prinsesa Manorah upang hindi makawala at tuluyang madala pabalik sa Udon Panjah at maibigay kay Prinsipe Suton nanoo'y naglalakbay rin sakay sa kabayo papunta sa kagubatan. Nakasalubong niya si Prahnbun dala-dala si Prinsesa Manorah. Agad-agad na naakit sa kagandahan ni Prinsesa Manorah ang prinsipe. Nang isalaysay ni Prahnbun kay Prinsipe Suton ang dahilan kung bakit niya hinuli at dinala ang prinsesa sa harap niya, nagpasalamat ang prinsipe at binayaran siya nito ng napakalaking halaga. Nagbalik ang prinsipe sa kaniyang palasyo dala-dala si Prinsesa Manorah kung saan umusbong ang isang tunay na pag-ibig sa isa't isa. Nang sabihin ng prinsipe sa kaniyang inang prinsesa at amang hari angbuong pangyayari, masayang-masaya sila at agad-agad nagbalak na magsagawa ng kasalpara kina PrinsipeSuton at PrisesaManorah. Bumalik sila sa palasyo ng Udon Panjah kung saan isinagawa ang kasal at tuluyang namuhay nang masaya't matiwasay habambuhay.</p>

    <div>
<p>Noong unang panahon, sa kaharian ng Albay ay may isang makapangyarihang Rajah. Siya ay may anak na kaakit-akit na ang palayaw sa kanya ng mga tao sa Daragang Magayon na ang kahuluga'y "Magandang Dalaga."</p>
<p>Maraming naakit sa kanyang taglay na kagandahan kaya di mabilang na mga datu at mga ginoong tanyag ang nag-alay sa kanya ng pagmamahal. Ang isa sa mga nanligaw ay si Kauen, anak ng mayamang Rajah sa kanugnog na kaharian. Naghandog ng mahalagang hiyas at ginto ang binata subalit tumanggi sa regalo ang dalaga. Si Kanuen ay nabigo subalit nagyabang pa na ang dalaga ay magiging kanya pagdating ng araw.</p>
<p>Mula sa malayong Katagalugan narinig ni Gat Malaya ang nabalitang kagandahan ni Daragang Magayon. Marami siyang mga pagkakataong makaniig ang paraluman subalit nagkaroon ng mga sagabal. Minsan, malapit sa munting ilog, nakita ang dalagang namumupol ng bulaklak. Kinamaya-maya'y ang binibini'y nagtampisaw sa batis. Ang binata'y nagparinig ng himig ng masayang awit upang matawag ang kanyang pansin. Nagkatitigan sila at ang binata'y nginitian.</p>
<p>Nabuhayan ng loob ang prinsipeng Tagalog at ito'y nagsalita, "Magandang Mutya, mula ako sa malayo upang ikaw ay sadyain at Makita ang tangi mong kariktan!"</p>
<p>"Sino ka? Hindi kita kilala! Isa kang pangahas!"</p>
<p>"Ako'y si Gat Malaya, galing sa kahariang malapit dito. Bigyan mo ako ng isang bulaklak at ako'y masisiyahan na!"</p>
<p>Bantulot na ihinagis ng dalaga ang bulaklak. Dumapo sa mga palad ng binata at ito'y kagyat na idinampi sa kaliwang dibdib.</p>
<p>"Maaari bang kita'y makitang muli?"</p>
<p>At nagsimula ang maraming tipanan ng dalawa sa makasaysayang batis.</p>
<p>"Isang araw," mungkahi ng lalaki, "kita'y iniibig. Tayo'y pakasal!"</p>
<p>"Ngunit ang Rajah? Ang aking ama?" may alinlangang paliwanag. "Dapat niyang malaman!"</p>
<p>"Huwag kang mag-alala! Hihingin ko ang kamay mo sa kanya!</p>
<p>Pumayag ang Rajah. Ang batang prinsipe ay kanyang nagustuhan pagkat magalang at nakakahalina kung kumilos. Itinakda ng Rajah ang kasal sa pagbibilog ng buwan, matapos ang anihan.</p>
<p>Nagpaalam si Gat Malaya upang ipabatid sa kanyang mga magulang ang itinakdang kasalan. Kakaunin niya ang ama't ina at silang tatlo ay babalik sa Albay.</p>
<p>Nabalitaan ni Kauen (nabigong manliligaw) ang napabalitang pag-iisang-dibdib. Kanyang sinamantala ang pagkakataong wala si Gat Malaya. Pinuntahan niya si Daragang Magayon.</p>
<p>Matigas ang pagtanggi ng dalaga sa kabila ng mga pagbabala: "Kung hindi kita makamtan, walang magkakamit sa iyo sinuman!"</p>
<p>Ang prinsesa ay natakot dahil sa pagbabala sa buhay niya at sa kanyang ama. Siya'y sumagot, "Ako'y magiging iyo kung si Gat Malaya ay hindi bumalik!"</p>
<p>Nagtumulin ang mga araw at mga lingo. Malapit na ang tag-ani ngunit wala pa si Malaya. Hindi pa siya nagbabalik. Gabi-gabi ang dalaga'y nakaupo sa duruwangawan at naghihintay.</p>
<p>Nang dumating ang kabilugan ng buwan napilitan nang pakasal si Daraga kay Kauen. Nagkaroon ng maringal na handaan -- kainan at sayawan.</p>
<p>Sa gitna ng kasayahan dumating si Gat Malaya kasama ang mga magulang.</p>
<p>"Ako'y naparito upang angkinin ang aking nobya!" sabi ni Malaya.</p>
<p>"Hindi maaari!" tugon ni Kauen.</p>
<p>Nagkaroon ng sukatan ng lakas. Magugunita na si Malay ay subok sa espada subalit si Kauen naman ay malansi at mapaglalang.</p>
<p>Nang ihahagis ni Kauen ang kanyang sibat, si Daragang Magayon ay tumakbo upang pumagitna at sawayin ang dalaga. Sa kasamaang-palad, ang sibat ay tumama sa dibdib ng dalaga. Niyakap ni Malaya ito ngunit pataksil na sinibat ng katunggali. Kapwa nalagutan ng hininga ang magsing-ibig.</p>
<p>Nagluksa ang Rajah at ang buong palasyo. Ipinag-utos niya na ang dalawa'y ilagak na magkasama sa isang hukay.</p>
<p>Lumipas ang mga araw. Himala ng mga himala. Ang lupa sa puntod ng libing ay tumaas hanggang sa itoy maging bundok. Napakaganda at perpekto ang hugis. Tinawag itong Bundok ng Mayon, bilang alaala kay Daragang Magayon.</p>

<p>Top 10 Successful Entrepreneurs in the Philippines</p>
<h2>1. Henry Sy, Shoe Mart</h2>
<p>SM is more than just a shopping mall. It is a beloved institution. Many of my favorite memories happened in SM. From shopping, watching blockbuster movies, date night, ice skating to food tripping, SM has it all.</p>
<p>However, this gigantic chain of more than 44 large-scale shopping centers in the Philippines and throughout Asia has very humble beginnings.</p>
<p>Henry Sy came from an impoverished family in Jinjiang, a town near Xiamen, China. The entire family left China in 1936 to help the family patriarch manage a thriving convenience store in Manila.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the family, their store was burned down during World War II. However, business-minded Henry saw an opportunity selling used military combat boots and other postwar goods from supportive American soldiers!</p>
<p>His success led to the opening of his first shoe store, the SM in Avenida, Manila. Henry had problems finding shoe manufacturers who could design shoes according to what he had in mind, but he persisted. He spoke to customers and built his own network of suppliers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>That never-say-die attitude got Henry Sy to where he is now: one of the richest men in the world and a world-class commercial center developer who provides opportunities to both entrepreneurs and the working class!</p>
<h2>2. Tony Tan Caktiong, Jollibee</h2>
<p>If you thought you only loved The Champ and Chicken Joy, then be prepared to be inspired by the man behind the franchise.</p>
<p>Also coming from an immigrant family from China, Tony learned the value of hard work and dedication from his father who worked as a cook in a Buddhist temple. Tony's father started a Chinese restaurant in Manila with his savings so he can send him to college.</p>
<p>In 1975, Tony bought a Magnolia ice cream parlor. However, it was not generating enough business. After talking with his customers and people within the neighborhood, Tony decided to include sandwiches, fried chicken, and French fries in the menu. In time, the restaurant found itself packed to overflowing capacity.</p>
<p>By 1978, Tony had opened six more restaurants, but the main item was no longer ice cream. Tony then decided to adapt the McDonald's concept and named his franchise after his work ethic of being as "busy as a bee."</p>
<p>Today Jollibee has grown to more than 2,500 stores in the Philippines plus locations in the US, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Singapore, and Brunei.</p>
<h2>3. John Gokongwei Jr., JG Holdings</h2>
<p>John's life story is a "rich-to-rags-to riches" story. John Jr. was born in China to the scion of one of the wealthiest families in Cebu.</p>
<p>When the father died, so did the business and the family fortune was soon gone. John Jr. supported his family by peddling items along the streets of Cebu by bike. Soon, he was trading items by boat to Lucena City and to Manila by truck. Eventually, he started importing items from the US.</p>
<p>John Jr. soon realized that importing carried too much risk and low margins. Thus, in 1957, he borrowed Php 500,000 from China Bank and started a corn milling business named Universal Corn Products.</p>
<p>By 1961, Universal started diversifying its products and launched several popular brands such as Blend 45. Universal Corn Products was renamed Universal Robina Corporation.</p>
<p>Today, the Gokongwei family owns several successful and highly diversified businesses. Among these are <strong>Robina Land Corporation</strong> and <strong>Cebu Pacific</strong></p>
<h2>4. Socorro C. Ramos, National Bookstore</h2>
<p>The next time you buy your batch of new school supplies and textbooks, do not forget to thank Ms. Socorro C. Ramos!</p>
<p>Her story is a stuff for telenovela, and frankly, I'm surprised the networks and movie outfits have not caught on. How's this for a plot teaser?</p>
<p>Girl's brother marries scion of a wealthy bookstore owner in Manila. The girl finds job as a saleslady at 18, meets and falls in love with the son of the owner; thus, he is technically her in-law! Their parents forbid the relationship and sends the girl back to the province. However, their love is so strong, girl and boy stand up to the parents, get married, and have twins.</p>
<p>The boy takes over a branch with the girl, and they renamed it in National Book Store. However, a war breaks out, and the store is destroyed! They rebuild the store, but everything is held under suspicion of being "questionable." They relocate the store in Avenida, but as the business picks up, a storm destroys their roof. Soon, they rebuild the store, and every centavo is used to build a nine-story National Book Store.</p>
<p>The girl is Socorro and the boy is Jose. Today, National Bookstore has grown to over 100 stores. Despite digital technology, it continues to flourish!</p>
<h2>5. Cecilio Kwok Pedro, Lamoiyan Corporation</h2>
<p>Cecilio's life is not a typical rags-to-riches story; instead, it embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds.</p>
<p>Cecilio used to head Aluminum Container Inc., which produced the aluminum toothpaste tubes for Procter and Gamble, Philippine Refining Company (now Unilever), and Colgate-Palmolive. However, environmental concerns led his clients to shift to plastic-laminated toothpaste tubes. Aluminum Container Inc. failed and closed its shop in 1986.</p>
<p>He put up Lamoiyan Corporation and manufactured toothpaste that was priced 50% lower than his competitors. These included the still-popular brands Hapee and Kutitap. Although the foreign brands countered by lowering their brands by 20%, Cecilio responded by introducing toothpaste targeted for children that featured the characters from <em>Sesame Street</em>.</p>
<p>Cecilio's brands have made it to other markets in Asia, such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Cecilio's greatest accomplishment was not limited to manufacturing. He is also known for his advocacy to help hearing-impaired people find employment in the country.</p>
<p>His programs include free housing for more than 30 deaf--mute staffs. To date, more than 180 hearing-impaired students have received college education through DEAF or Deaf Evangelistic Alliance Foundation.</p>
<h2>6. Mariano Que, Mercury Drugstores</h2>
<p>Many of today's entrepreneurs would learn the value of customer experience and innovation through Mariano Que.</p>
<p>Like many of the entrepreneurs discussed so far, Mariano found opportunities for entrepreneurship after World War 2. Mariano had been working in a local drugstore when the war destroyed several businesses in the city.</p>
<p>Mariano saw the need to supply sulfa drugs, which were used to treat bacterial infections. He started to buy sulfa tablets and sold them at affordable prices. Soon, other people followed and adapted Mariano's strategy.</p>
<p>However, only Mariano sold high-quality sulfa tablets, which ensured him a steady clientele. With his hard work and dedication to build up savings, he was able to put up his first drug store in 1945, which he named Mercury Drug. The Roman god Mercury is known for speed. He also carries the caduceus, which is a symbol in the medical industry.</p>
<p>Mariano invested his earnings into the company and introduced many innovations in the service. Among these innovations were a drug-delivery service to clients and locations that are open 24/7 because he knew people would be needing medicines any time of the day.</p>
<p>By the time Mariano opened his second Mercury Drug at the newly constructed Ayala shopping center in Makati, he had invested in technological innovations, such as biological refrigerators and computer-guided controls.</p>
<p>Mariano's dedication to his business has allowed <strong>Mercury Drug</strong> into 700 stores and a widely recognized name for quality pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h2>7. Alfredo M. Yao, Zest-O</h2>
<p>The next time you pass a vendor peddling goods on the street, keep in mind that he or she can be supporting the next Alfredo M. Yao.</p>
<p>When Alfredo lost his dad at age 12, his mother was left to support him and his siblings by becoming a sidewalk vendor. A relative was able to give financial aid, which allowed Alfredo to reach, but not complete, college at the MapÃºa Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Alfredo took several odd jobs, which included time at a printing press. During his stay there, Alfredo learned how to print cellophane wrappers for candies and biscuits. His experience prompted him to start his own printing business.</p>
<p>His printing business was doing well. However, his discovery of the Doy Packaging system from Europe was the turning point of his entrepreneurial career. He tried to sell the system to juice manufacturers, but no one was interested. Thus, Alfredo ventured into the juice business by concocting flavors in his kitchen.</p>
<p>These juices were not only delicious but also appealing to parents as they found the light and brightly colored packs easy to include in their children's lunch boxes. Best of all, the packaging allowed the juice to stay chilled longer. Zest-O was born!</p>
<p>Today, Zest-O controls 80% of the juice market, and it has expanded to markets in Australia, China, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, US, and several countries in Europe. Alfredo's entrepreneurial success has revitalized the juice region in the Philippines particularly farmers growing dalandan. The Doy packs are also recycled by local cottage industries into handbags for export to other countries!</p>
<p>The boy who once faced the harsh realities of life now become a successful juice manufacturer. Alfredo has diversified his business interests into airlines by acquiring Asian Spirit Airlines and renaming it as <strong>Zest Air</strong>.</p>
<p>Alfredo is now literally on top of the world!</p>
<h2>8. Corazon D. Ong, CDO Foodsphere</h2>
<p>Corazon represented the value of having passion in what you do as a motivating factor in finding success as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Corazon was a dietitian by profession. She used her knowledge to create processed meats that were affordable enough to compete with the popular foreign brands. She developed corned beef, hamburger patties, meat loaf, and hotdogs, which were sold purely as a home business.</p>
<p>By 1975, Corazon decided to scale her newfound business and established <strong>CDO Foodsphere</strong>. The company's reputation to develop high-quality but low-priced processed meats quickly spread and made CDO a regular staple in every shopping cart.</p>
<p>As a mother herself Corazon understood the value of having meals that can be prepared easily, taste good, and fit the family budget.</p>
<p>In time, CDO expanded to industrial markets. Today, CDO supplies processed meats to 90% of quick service restaurants or QSRs in the country.</p>
<h2>9. Gregorio G. Sanchez Jr., LactoPAFI</h2>
<p>While working as a provincial board member in Cebu, Gregorio noticed that pigs sold to market were apparently malnourished.</p>
<p>He decided to look into the cause of malnutrition by doing research in his spare time. Using only pots and pans in his home, Gregorio conducted several tests and experiments on how to alleviate the state of malnutrition of Cebu's livestock.</p>
<p>Despite numerous failures, his persistence finally paid off. He discovered the pigs were suffering from a type of bad bacteria. His solution was a probiotic bacteria that would increase the level of good bacteria in the body.</p>
<p>The bacteria would be called <strong>LactoPAFI Probiotic Bacteria</strong>. Gregorio's discovery would reach global acclaim as a leader in probiotics. It is now exported to New Zealand, Norway, France, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and US.</p>
<h2>10. Diosdado Banatao, Computer Chips</h2>
<p>Diosdado's life story exhibits perseverance, hope, determination, and the power of self-belief. The son of a farmer in Cagayan, Diosdado would walk barefoot just to complete his high school education. His resilience made him a Magna Cum Laude graduate in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>His excellence in the academe paved the way for Diosdado to become a pilot-trainee at the Philippines Airlines or PAL, which would eventually open doors for a design engineer position at Boeing Co. The opportunity brought Diosdado to the US where he completed a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Diosdado's experience working with the top technology companies led to his design of the first single-chip 16-bit microprocessor calculator. By 1981, Diosdado was commissioned by Seeq Technologies to assist the Ethernet to find an efficient way of linking computers. Disodado designed the single- chip controller that provided data-link control and the transceiver in the first 10-bit Ethernet CMOS.</p>
<p>His success opened doors to build his own company, Monstroni, in 1985 and Chips and Technology, which made US\$ 12 million in the first quarter alone. By 1996, Diosdado sold Chips and Technology to Intel for US\$ 430 million!</p>
<p>Throughout his success, Diosdado never forgot his roots and Filipino heritage. He set up the Banatao Filipino American Fund to lend support to Filipino American students in Northern California who aspire to become electrical engineers.</p>

<h2>Talambuhay Ni Andres Bonifacio</h2>
<p>Ipinanganak ang bayaning si Andres Bonifacio noong Nobyembre 30, 1863 sa syudad ng Maynila. Ang kanyang ama ay si ginoong Santiago Bonifacio at ang kanyang ina naman ay si ginang Catalina de Castro.</p>
<p>Panganay si Andres sa anim na magkakapatid at sa murang edad na katorse ay natuto nang maghanapbuhay si Andress buhat noong magkasunod na mamatay ang kanyang mga magulang.</p>
<p>Itinigil na din ni Andres ang kanyang pag-aaral kapalit ng pag tataguyod nya sa limang nakababatang kapatid. Dahil sa likas na talento ni Andres sa gawaing kamay ay natuto syang gumawa ng baston, pamaypay at mga karatula na syang ibinebenta.</p>
<p>Di tumagal ay nagtrabaho si Andres bilang mensahero sa dayuhang kompanya na Fleming and Company. Bukod dito ay nagtrabaho din sya sa isa pang dayuhang kumpanya na Fressel and Company.</p>
<p>Dito natuto si Andres ng salitang ingles. Kahit hindi nakapagtapos ay natuto din si Andres ng salitang espanyol. Nahubog ang kanyang kaalaman sa pagbabasa ng mga librong tungkol sa mga pangulo ng estados unidos, mga nobela ni Rizal tulad ng Noli Me Tangere, El Filibusterismo, Les Miserables at iba pa.</p>
<p>Si Andres ay dalawang beses nag asawa. Una syang ikinasal kay Monica Palomar ng Tondo. Ngunit maaga ding nabyudo si Andres sapagkat si Monica ay namatay sa sakit na ketong. Di sila pinalad na magka anak.</p>
<p>Taong 1892 ay nakilala naman ni Andres ang ikalawang asawa na si Gregoria de Jesus o mas kilala sa tawag na Oryang. Noong una ay tutol ang magulang ni Oryang sa pag iibigan ng dalawa dahil si Andres ay isang freemason at tinuturing na kalaban ng Simbahang katoliko. Ngunit kalaunay nagpakasal din ang dalawa taong 1893 sa simbahan ng Binondo. Nagkaroon sila ng anak na nagngangalan ding Andres ngunit si Andres Jr. ay maagang namatay sa sakit na bulutong.</p>
<p>Unang naging bahagi ng katipunan si Andres noong 1892 pagkatapos na ipatapon si Jose Rizal sa Dapitan.</p>
<p>Nabunyag ang kilusang KKK sa mga espanyol at taong 1896 noong maganap ang \"Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin\" o ang pagpilas sa cedula laban sa mga espanyol.</p>
<p>Naganap ang laban ng katipunan laban sa mga espanyol noong Agosto 30, 1896 at maraming umuwing sugatan. Ang labang iyon ay naging malaking banta laban sa mga mananakop na espanyol.</p>
<p>Nagkaroon ng dalawang grupo ang katipunan ito ay ang Magdalo at Magdiwang na pinamumunuan ng pinsan ni Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>Nagkaroon ng pulong na ginanap noong ika 22 ng Marso taong 1897 sa Tejeros, Cavite. Napagpasyahan na maghalal ng pangulo ng unang republika ng Pilipinas. Nahalal na pangulo si Emilio Aguinaldo at naging pangalawang pangulo naman si Andres.</p>
<p>Dahil hindi matanggap ni Andres ang naging resulta ng halalan at pinawalang bisa nya ito. Ngunit kinabukasan ay nanumpa na si Aguinaldo bilang pangulo.</p>
<p>Habang si Andres ay nasa Indang, Cavite ay inatake sila ng Magdalo ngunit inutos ni Andres sa kanyang mga tauhan na wag nang lumaban. Si Andres ay inaresto sa salang pagtataksil laban sa pamahalaang Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>Nilitis si Andres at napatunayang nagkasala at mahatulan ng parusang kamatayan.</p>
<p>Si Andres ay binitay sa bundok ng Maragondon kasama ang kapatid na lalaki na si Procopio noong ika 10 ng Mayo taong 1897.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Indicated by the bluish tinge of the tongue due to insufficient supple of oxygen</p>
</li>
<li>

</ol>
<p>Kinds of Anemia:</p>
<p>â€‹           a.  Iron deficiency anemia -- the bone morrow fails to produce sufficient red blood cells</p>
<p>â€‹           b.  Aplastic anemia -- due to inadequate production of red blood cells in the bone marrow</p>
<p>â€‹           c.  Sickle cell anemia -- caused by a defective gene that produces an abnormal form of hemoglobin</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Polycythemia -- a condition wherein the blood contains an abnormal large number of red blood cells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leukemia -- begins when immature blood cells called progenitor cells divide uncontrollably. There is also a significant decrease in the concentration of red blood cells in the blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemophilia - -hereditary blood disease, characterized by the inability of blood to clot leading to hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding, even from minor injuries</p>
</li>

<p>The Circulatory System is the transport system of the body. It is responsible for the distribution of blood throughout the body.</p>
<h2>The Heart</h2>
<p>The pumping organ of the circulatory system. Located at the center of the chest slightly tilted to the left</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atria -- responsible for receiving used blood coming from all part of the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventricle -- pumping chamber of the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valves -- overlapping layers of tissue that allow blood to flow in only one direction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Blood</h2>
<p>The liquid medium that is constantly flowing throughout the body</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Red Blood cells -- small, spherical, enucleated and biconcave cells -- transport gases (oxygen and Carbon dioxide) respectively to and from the cells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White Blood Cells -- irregular in shape and are slightly larger than the red blood cells -- they fight bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that cause infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platelets -- smallest of the formed components of the blood -- help stop bleeding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plasma -- Liquid part of the blood</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Blood Vessels</h2>
<p>Vast network of tubes that carry blood throughout your body</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Arteries -- carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aorta -- largest artery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arterioles -- smallest arteries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Veins -- thin walled and loose blood vessels -- carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vena Cava -- largest vein</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venules -- smallest veins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capillaries -- smallest blood vessels -- oxygen, food nutrients and wastes pass through their walls</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lympathic System</h2>
<p>It is an accessory system of the circulatory system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Absorbs fats from the intestine to the blood streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes and destroys toxic substance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevents the spread of diseases throughout the body</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fluid, called lymph, passes through the lymph nodes before it is returned to the blood circulation</p>
<p>Lymph nodes are masses of tissues composed of many white blood cells</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>The <strong>sphygmomanometer</strong> is a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow and a mechanical manometer to measure the pressure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Geology -- this branch of science involves the study of the origin, history, evolution, and structure of the earth's crust</li>
<li>Paleontology -- this is the scientific study if prehistoric life, based mainly on fossils if animals and plants</li>
<li>Meteorology -- this is the study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and forecasting</li>
<li>Seismology -- this is the study of earthquakes and the movement of waves through the Earth</li>
<li>Astronomy-- this is the study of celestial bodies, such as stars, comets, planets, and galaxies, and phenomena, that originate outside the earth's atmosphere, such as cosmic background radiation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life sciences</strong> -- deal with the study of living organisms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology -- this deals with the study if living things.</li>
<li>Botany - this deals with the study if plants.</li>
<li>Zoology - this deals with the study if animals---their firm and structure.</li>
<li>Ecology -- this deals with the study of the relationship of living organism with each other and their interaction with their surroundings.</li>
