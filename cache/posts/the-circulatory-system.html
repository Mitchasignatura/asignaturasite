<p><strong>The Circulatory System</strong></p>
<p>The Circulatory System is the transport system of the body. It is responsible for the distribution of blood throughout the body.</p>
<p>THE HEART</p>
<p>The pumping organ of the circulatory system. Located at the center of the chest slightly tilted to the left</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atria -- responsible for receiving used blood coming from all part of the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventricle -- pumping chamber of the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valves -- overlapping layers of tissue that allow blood to flow in only one direction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THE BLOOD</p>
<p>The liquid medium that is constantly flowing throughout the body</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Red Blood cells -- small, spherical, enucleated and biconcave cells -- transport gases (oxygen and Carbon dioxide) respectively to and from the cells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White Blood Cells -- irregular in shape and are slightly larger than the red blood cells -- they fight bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that cause infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platelets -- smallest of the formed components of the blood -- help stop bleeding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plasma -- Liquid part of the blood</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THE BLOOD VESSELS</p>
<p>Vast network of tubes that carry blood throughout your body</p>
<ul>
<li>Arteries -- carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart</li>
</ul>
<p>Aorta -- largest artery</p>
<p>Arterioles -- smallest arteries</p>
<ul>
<li>Veins -- thin walled and loose blood vessels -- carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart</li>
</ul>
<p>Vena Cava -- largest vein</p>
<p>Venules -- smallest veins</p>
<ul>
<li>Capillaries -- smallest blood vessels -- oxygen, food nutrients and wastes pass through their walls</li>
</ul>
<p>LYMPHATIC SYSTEM</p>
<p>It is an accessory system of the circulatory system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Absorbs fats from the intestine to the blood streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes and destroys toxic substance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevents the spread of diseases throughout the body</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fluid, called lymph, passes through the lymph nodes before it is returned to the blood circulation</p>
<p>Lymph nodes are masses of tissues composed of many white blood cells</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>The <strong>Sphygmomanometer</strong> is a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow and a mechanical manometer to measure the pressure.</p>
