<p><strong>HEART DISEASES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Congenital Heart Disease -- Blue Baby Syndrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caused by heart valve defects and problems with a heart muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disease of a new born infants when opening between the right and left atria or right and left ventricle remains open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicated by the bluish tinge of the tongue due to insufficient supple of oxygen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Angina Pectoris -- due to insufficient oxygen reaching the heart muscle caused by the narrowing or the obstruction of the coronary artery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart Failure -- the heart muscle weaken and are unable to pump enough blood to the body</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>BLOOD VESSEL DISEASES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Aneurysm -- condition wherein the aorta of the heart and the artery within the skull bulge during an increase in blood pressure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypertension -- also known as high blood pressure. The systolic pressure is higher than 120 and the diastolic pressure is higher than 80</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries is the fundamental cause of the coronary heart disease and the interruption of the blood flow through the arteries of the brain, which results to stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stroke -- known as cerebrovascular damage -- caused by a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain. It may be caused by a blood clot in one of the arteries, or the rapture of an artery wall in the brain with the accompanying escape of the blood in the brain tissue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrombosis -- formation of the blood clot, or thrombus, inside a blood vessel, completely blocking the flow of blood through it</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>BLOOD DISEASES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Anemia -- abnormally low number of red blood cells or low level of hemoglobin</li>
</ol>
<p>Kinds of Anemia:</p>
<p>​           a.  Iron deficiency anemia -- the bone morrow fails to produce sufficient red blood cells</p>
<p>​           b.  Aplastic anemia -- due to inadequate production of red blood cells in the bone marrow</p>
<p>​           c.  Sickle cell anemia -- caused by a defective gene that produces an abnormal form of hemoglobin</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Polycythemia -- a condition wherein the blood contains an abnormal large number of red blood cells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leukemia -- begins when immature blood cells called progenitor cells divide uncontrollably. There is also a significant decrease in the concentration of red blood cells in the blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemophilia - -hereditary blood disease, characterized by the inability of blood to clot leading to hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding, even from minor injuries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpura -- condition wherein te numerous small patchy hemorrhages on the skin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Petechiae -- tiny pinpoint hemorrhage occurring around the hair follicle</p>
</li>
